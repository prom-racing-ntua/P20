1. Rules for writing final code:
   - Any final code must have documentations
   - Any final code must have extensive comments of the reasoning behind any:
     - Not obvious coding decisions
     - Difficultly in development
   - Any solution found online must be referenced inside the code and in the REFERENCE in the rep:
     - Inside the code the reference is an annotation to the REFERENCE file
   - First line must be the comment, #import libraries. 
   - Under it we import everything that we use from our standard libraries, kivy and matplotlib
   - Any additional libraries will be imported right after
     - If imported there must be the comment extra libraries and the reason the are imported
     - Any library that needs further installation cannot be used unless first discussed with the team
   - The code is supposed to be modular, therefore each file should be as small as possible
     - This practice also helps with the troubleshooting of our code
   
2. Rules of projects structure:
   - Every media files, anything from icons to music, can only be saved in the assets directory
